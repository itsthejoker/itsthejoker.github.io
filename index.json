[{"content":" My favorite projects and places you can see or hear me! Open Source Software # FilamentColors.xyz # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e In 3D printing, getting the right color of filament for a project is often a pain. Have you ever wondered \u0026ldquo;what filament do I need to get to match this color?\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;what looks good with this filament I already have?\u0026rdquo; These are questions FilamentColors.xyz tries to answer by providing a filament color database with over a thousand different filaments from all over the world \u0026ndash; each one printed, measured, and automatically grouped into pre-built color palettes ready for you to use in your next project!\nGrafeas Group, Ltd # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e A small international nonprofit that I co-founded with James Coe, this registered 501(c)3 in the US has over 5,875 volunteers and aims to increase accessibility on the internet. By creating text versions of internet content, everyone has a chance to participate in the discussion. Our volunteers have, at the time of this writing, completed over 270,000 transcriptions and descriptions online and through Reddit for those who need them.\nThe organization uses six bots total; three on Reddit\u0026rsquo;s side and three internal bots for managing ourselves and our community.\nGrafeas: The External Bots # u/transcribersofreddit # The primary bot that volunteers interact with, this bot is responsible for finding new content, posting it to the subreddit, and working with volunteers as they complete transcription jobs. This is the first bot that I wrote for the project, and the very first version was knocked out in my airb\u0026amp;b room in between PyCon sessions in 2017!\nu/transcribot # Sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s helpful to have a starting point for some of the longer transcriptions, so u/transcribot runs each and every picture through OCR and posts the (often hilariously wrong) results where the volunteers can access them. It follows u/transcribersofreddit around our subreddit, toddling along and trying its best.\nu/ToR_Archivist # Arguably the least-known of the trio, the Archivist takes completed posts, grabs the link to the actual completed transcription, and posts it to the TranscribersOfReddit Archive for folks who need it. It also removes posts from the primary job board as they \u0026lsquo;age out\u0026rsquo; if no one claims them.\nGrafeas: The Internal Bots # Blossom # The Django monolith that powers it all and the keeper of our data! Blossom is where all of our central processing takes place; the other five bots make very few decisions for themselves and mostly look to Blossom for guidance. Blossom also powers the organization homepage, grafeas.org!\nBubbles # Every organization needs an overly chatty chatbot, and Grafeas is no different. Bubbles runs in our internal Slack and assists with anything we need \u0026ndash; anything from gathering data on potential subreddits to providing pictures of cute animals to handling our deployments of all six bots (including herself!) to production!\nButtercup # Buttercup runs our volunteer Discord! Host to a whole bunch of cool commands and data visualization stuff, Buttercup helps enforce username standards and also allows volunteers to track their progress on various challenges and get access to other cool data to see how they\u0026rsquo;re doing.\nGrafeas: The Other Stuff # Occasionally we work on other systems as we prototype ideas or spin out functionality into other repositories as needed.\nUtonium # As we grew Bubbles, we realized quickly that the slack-bolt package that Bubbles used was not really designed to handle all the commands that Bubbles has, so I designed a plugin system from the ground up to handle the (vaguely ridiculous) number of Slack commands that we need to handle across different platforms. It\u0026rsquo;s not the easiest to integrate, but works well for our needs!\nCaroline # An idea that we toyed around with for using Redis or Elasticsearch as a pseudo-relational backend that relies on JSON Schema for validation. Still a project that I\u0026rsquo;m quite proud of, even though I\u0026rsquo;m not sure it should ever actually be used.\nasbestos # At SpotOn, we work with a lot of data in Snowflake but there is was no way to mock the connection cleanly for testing functions that use Snowflake data or for developing against a Snowflake call and paying to run the same query over and over. Enter asbestos, a project named after the fake snow from The Wizard of Oz. (That\u0026rsquo;s true: the snow used in the movie is 100% pure asbestos. Horrifying, isn\u0026rsquo;t it?) Asbestos allows you to mock the Snowflake connection, store SQL queries and expected answers, and then spit back the answers when you call Snowflake normally.\nFun fact: the original name for this project was snowfake, but Snowflake\u0026rsquo;s lawyers told us we couldn\u0026rsquo;t do that. ðŸ˜­\nemailmagic # mailto: links are annoying, and it\u0026rsquo;s weird to me that we don\u0026rsquo;t have an industry solution to this problem yet. emailmagic watches for mailto: links, then makes the link pop up a modal so you can open the link in your preferred email client or just use the default browser behavior. On the sites that I write myself (e.g. not this one), I use Bootstrap as my UI library of choice so that I don\u0026rsquo;t have to reimplement everything from scratch, and emailmagic is styled using Bootstrap 5 so that it can be a clean drop-in addition.

Sometimes a project just sticks in your head and won\u0026rsquo;t let go; for days, months, or even years. This is the story of one such project.\nASCIIQuarium # In a previous job as a software developer around 2016, I came across this script from Kirk Baucom called asciiquarium. It\u0026rsquo;s a single-file script that animates a lovely ocean scene using only text! Fish swim, a small castle chills out in the corner, and occasionally special events happen (watch for the shark and appearances of Nessie!). I ran it in a small terminal window every day around my normal work, enjoying it simply for being a quick escape from whatever problem I was working on at the time.\nASCIIQuarium screenshot courtesy of robobunny.com During that time, I had an idea: use a low-power computer, an old display, and a bit of solder to create a permanent display for asciiquarium to have my very own digital fish tank that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t need feeding (and had pretty colors)! It took a long time to come to fruition, but I\u0026rsquo;m incredibly happy with how it turned out. Read on for details!\nThe Parts # The original plan was to use a Raspberry Pi Zero (I have a lot of them), but when I ventured out to the garage to see what I could find in terms of a screen, the only thing that came up in my search was my partner\u0026rsquo;s old 22\u0026quot; TV from college. As an older TV, my connection options were limited to VGA, RCA, component, or S-Video. That wasn\u0026rsquo;t a total killer though, because the Raspberry Pi 1 Model A (retro circa 2013!) has an RCA video out!\nSparkFun Electronics from Boulder, USA - Raspberry Pi - Model A, CC BY 2.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=26785859 Our donor screen is an Emerson 22\u0026quot; TV / DVD combo. It served a loyal life, delivering many marathons of the Lord of the Rings (extended editions!), but was eventually relegated to the garage. There\u0026rsquo;s no remote anymore, so who knows what extra features it\u0026rsquo;s supposed to have. What we care about, and what matters, is that when it turns on, it launches directly into Video 1 mode (where our RCA input is plugged in).\nTo power the Pi, I found an old Samsung phone charger that we don\u0026rsquo;t have anymore and a no-brand micro-USB cable. After testing to ensure that it met the power requirements of the Pi, it was time to get the software sorted.\nThe Software # ASCIIQuarium is a relatively small script written in Perl that only needs a little bit of setup in order to get working. The original source can be downloaded from Kirk Baucom\u0026rsquo;s site, but the version I\u0026rsquo;m running is actually one that I edited myself to reduce the frequency of special events and make it more suited for this type of installation. The modified version can be downloaded from GitHub.\nI want to give a major shout-out to the Raspberry Pi Foundation for their amazing support of old hardware; getting the Pi set up was a breeze by just downloading the latest command-line-only version of Raspbian and flashing it to an SD card using the new Raspberry Pi Imager.\nI ran into one issue with LC_LOCALES and other keys not being set correctly; running \u0026ldquo;raspi-config\u0026rdquo; and setting the locale information there fixed the problem after rebooting. Perl is included in the default of Raspbian, so the only requirements we have are to install the curses library (a library that allows us to draw in the terminal) and install the Term::Animation package using Perl\u0026rsquo;s CPAN command to actually handle the movements.\n# this first part might take a while sudo apt update sudo apt upgrade -y # dependencies! sudo apt install libcurses-perl git # just accept the defaults if it asks you things sudo cpan install Term::Animation # Grab the modified code git clone https://github.com/itsthejoker/asciiquarium After cloning the repo, we can move into the folder (cd asciiquarium) and make the program runnable with chmod +x asciiquarium. Running it by calling ./asciiqurium shows that it works and everything\u0026rsquo;s animating! The last thing to do is make it run on startup, which is easily doable by adding an extra line to the .bash_profile file: /home/pi/asciiquarium/asciiquarium.\nThe Assembly # Actually assembling everything is fairly straight-forward, but it did require some soldering. One of the things that I wanted for this build was that it would only require one cable; that meant that I had to wire the USB charger into the TV somehow. After cracking open the charger to free the circuit board, opening up the back of the TV (don\u0026rsquo;t do this unless you know what you\u0026rsquo;re doing!) showed that there was a great safe place to solder in the charger with access to the 120v power cable. Test fits and a little hot glue helped secure the charger in an out-of-the-way location on the main board of the TV.\nOne gutted charger in the guts of a TV! With the USB power in place, only two things remain: securing the Pi to the back of the TV and getting it ready to install. The first was easy enough to solve with \u0026ndash; you guessed it \u0026ndash; more hot glue (though the Pi was placed into a case first!). The wiring was connected again to make sure it worked, and this is the wiring arrangement I came up with:\nAn acrylic case to the rescue for keeping my Pi safe! After confirming that it worked as expected, the next step is to pull the SD card and back it up. This installation will be turned on and off by the power plug through a timer, so it\u0026rsquo;s important to make the operating system read-only to guard against corruption. After making it read-only, no changes can be made \u0026ndash; so backing it up prior to performing that operation is critical.\nSeriously, if you\u0026rsquo;re following along, back up your SD card now. Take a full disk image using something like Win32Imager \u0026ndash; you don\u0026rsquo;t want to make your OS read-only and THEN find out that something is wrong. You\u0026rsquo;d have to wipe it and start from scratch. I used this article from Adafruit to actually perform the operation with the card plugged into a different Pi, and as far as I can tell it worked perfectly. When the SD card was slotted back into the Pi on the TV, everything worked perfectly!\n\u0026hellip;well, almost. It turns out that pretty much all TVs are designed so that when they\u0026rsquo;re plugged in, they don\u0026rsquo;t turn on automatically. This is a problem for this install because it\u0026rsquo;ll be turned on and off by the timer. Thankfully, the internet comes through once more with a solution\u0026hellip; involving more hot glue.\nYep. Not going anywhere. The Results # Officially, that brings this \u0026ldquo;aquarium\u0026rdquo; to completion. A single power cable, easy power control, and lovely analog feel thanks to the RCA cable \u0026ndash; overall a really easy project that\u0026rsquo;s been several years in the making.\n4fps.

All of this reading and we\u0026rsquo;ve finally made it to the end of the process! The previous post touched on things to know before and during the print, so we\u0026rsquo;ll wrap up the series with a bit of knowledge on things you should know about the end of the process.\nIn this post, we\u0026rsquo;ll talk about:\nThe end of a 3D print Failed prints Cleaning up Finishing Touches Printer Maintenance What Happens When a Print Finishes? # One of the best parts of owning a 3D printer is the anticipation and excitement of seeing the completed part that it just created. A machine in my home that can take a few meters of plastic line and turn it into something amazing \u0026ndash; what\u0026rsquo;s not to like? Every 3D printer has a different way of announcing that it\u0026rsquo;s done with a job, but generally the important part is that the machine will move the hot end out of the way so you can access the part that just finished printing. This next part is so important it\u0026rsquo;s going in its own little bubble:\nYou won\u0026rsquo;t be able to remove a printed object from the build surface of the printer immediately when it\u0026rsquo;s done \u0026ndash; you must wait for it to cool down. The part will get progressively easier to remove as the machine cools down; the sooner you try to remove it, the more you risk damaging your part and printer through brute force. Sometimes a part will pop off the build plate after it cools down and you can pick it right up\u0026hellip; but sometimes it will require some gentle (but firm) force. You\u0026rsquo;ll want to use the print removal tool \u0026ndash; or, very carefully, a utility knife blade \u0026ndash; to get under the part so that it can lift off the build plate.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll want to make sure to be extra careful if you\u0026rsquo;re using anything sharp; one wrong move and you\u0026rsquo;ll damage the build plate, the part you just printed, or yourself. Sometimes removing a part can take a few minutes, so don\u0026rsquo;t be discouraged. Take your time and go slow. This is also a great reason to look into a 3D printer that has a removable, flexible build plate: it makes removing prints much easier at the cost of a slightly more expensive setup.\nSometimes Prints Fail\u0026hellip; and That\u0026rsquo;s Okay # Running a 3D printer is an inexact science. Sometimes parts don\u0026rsquo;t stick to the build plate; sometimes the nozzle will jam; sometimes things won\u0026rsquo;t move the way that they should. It\u0026rsquo;s not just you \u0026ndash; it\u0026rsquo;s something that literally everyone deals with in this hobby. Sometimes it will take several tries before you get a result that you\u0026rsquo;re happy with, and that may require tweaking the physical printer or the settings in your slicer program.\nMost of the time, print failures don\u0026rsquo;t get very far! Image thanks to @tgibriday The best way to approach this when it happens is to clean up the plastic spaghetti and try again. It\u0026rsquo;s important to watch at least the first layer get printed, as most failures will happen at this time. There are many, many different things that could be wrong (nozzle too close to the bed, nozzle too far away from the bed, wrong temperatures, oil on the build surface, etc.) It\u0026rsquo;s also a great idea to check on things occasionally just to make sure that it\u0026rsquo;s still trundling along.\nSometimes they\u0026rsquo;re a bit more effort to clean up \u0026ndash; this one wasn\u0026rsquo;t caught for several hours. Image thanks to @uncommonparts This particular print failed sometime during the night! Sometimes failures trend more towards \u0026ldquo;crap, it\u0026rsquo;s broken\u0026rdquo; levels \u0026ndash; and that\u0026rsquo;s okay too! That\u0026rsquo;s where the tinkering comes in, because there are very few issues that are not fixable. That\u0026rsquo;s part of the fun!\nCleaning Up Your Workspace # When you run a 3D printer for a little bit, you\u0026rsquo;ll find that there are little bits of plastic left over from the printing process that aren\u0026rsquo;t actually usable or a part of your projects \u0026ndash; this is waste plastic. It\u0026rsquo;s plastic used to make sure that everything is flowing correctly, plastic used to make sure that prints are adhering to the bed, or plastic used to make sure that a color change has worked. There\u0026rsquo;s no use in keeping any of this, so it goes straight into the trash. You\u0026rsquo;ll want to keep a small trash can nearby so that you have somewhere handy to throw these bits \u0026ndash; they accumulate startlingly fast.\nThere will also be other trash from things like new spools or new parts if you tinker with the machine a lot; all that will also need to find a new home in the trash can.\nCleaning Up Your Prints # Not every 3D print comes off the printer looking amazing \u0026ndash; there may be some extra work that should happen. Small strings can be vaporized with a hairdryer set to \u0026ldquo;hot\u0026rdquo; and little blobs can pop off with a little help from a hobby knife.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t already have a hobby knife (commonly sold under the brand names X-Acto and Excel), we recommend one that tightens at the back of the knife instead of at the blade. This type also commonly has a small metal plate that stops it from rolling on the table! Hobby knives are extremely sharp; make sure it stays capped and put away when not in use. Some more complicated parts will require support material \u0026ndash; extra plastic that will get thrown away but whose only job is to help the overall print succeed \u0026ndash; that will need to be trimmed away. A small pair of micro pliers can help break away material and a set of flush cutters will help tremendously.\nFlush cutters are so useful that they tend to disappear to other places. If tools have a habit of misplacing themselves, you may want to get a few of them. Putting the Finishing Touches on Your 3D Prints # Sometimes you may want to make something that doesn\u0026rsquo;t quite fit on your 3D printer. If that\u0026rsquo;s the case, there may be a few pieces that fit together with screws or glue. Screws are easier because they don\u0026rsquo;t usually scuff up the surface of your work, but they have extra costs in actually buying the hardware\u0026hellip; so sometimes that just leaves glue as the next best option. If gluing together parts is something that you\u0026rsquo;re interested in doing, you\u0026rsquo;ll want to put some plastic-specific glues on your wishlist; something like 3D Gloop may be a good place to start.\nAlthough it may be tempting, be careful when using superglue (sometimes called cyanoacrylate or just \u0026ldquo;CA\u0026rdquo; glue) \u0026ndash; it\u0026rsquo;s really good at what it does, but reacts badly with most plastics and leaves white blemishes everywhere it touches. That may not be an issue depending on what you\u0026rsquo;re gluing together, but it\u0026rsquo;s worth noting. Sometimes prints just don\u0026rsquo;t have enough pizzazz if they\u0026rsquo;re just the color of the plastic, so painting might be the next step. Painting is a huge topic, and the folks at All3DP have a great primer (pun intended) about painting PLA and ABS 3D prints \u0026ndash; check it out here!\nPrinter Maintenance # 3D printers are movement-heavy over a small amount of area, so keeping up with maintenance is important. Most of the time, you\u0026rsquo;ll just need a little oil; if you\u0026rsquo;re in a pinch, 3-In-One Multipurpose Oil will do a great job of keeping things moving smoothly, but for most things on a 3D printer some white lithium grease is the best choice. 3-In-One or other lighter oils will need to be reapplied more frequently, but they also work better at getting into cracks and crevices.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t use anything heavier than white lithium grease; if the grease is too heavy (or if there\u0026rsquo;s too much), it will cause more of a problem than not having it at all. Also\u0026hellip;\nDo not use WD-40! They say it can do anything\u0026hellip; and what it will do is gum up the bearings in your machine. Stick with the two options outlined above. Dust and hair stick to grease, so if the machine is in a dusty (or pet-heavy) area, it might need additional cleaning. A little compressed air can help get plastic bits and dust out of hard-to-reach corners! Belts degrade over time (very slowly) so an occasional check to make sure they\u0026rsquo;re still tight is a good idea.\nWrapping Up # Over the last four posts, we\u0026rsquo;ve gone over things you need to know from \u0026ldquo;what is this 3D print thing\u0026rdquo; all the way to finishing your first print. There\u0026rsquo;s a wealth of good information online about how to fix potential issues, modifications for whatever printer you may want to get, suggestions for various improvements, and more. If you\u0026rsquo;re interested in reading more, Matterhackers has an excellent set of articles about getting started in 3D printing that anyone should read. They definitely aren\u0026rsquo;t required to really dive in, though!\nIf 3D printing as a hobby is interesting to you and you\u0026rsquo;re not worried about the possibility of getting some grease on your hands, then take a look at some of the machines that are out there. The great thing about the 3D printing community is that it thrives on sharing knowledge and wisdom; if you\u0026rsquo;re curious about something, reach out and ask! There\u0026rsquo;s always someone around with suggestions or ideas for what to try next.\n","date":"16 August 2020","permalink":"/posts/intro_to_3d_printing_part_4/","section":"Posts","summary":"In the last post in \u003cem\u003eIntro to 3D Printing\u003c/em\u003e, we cover cleaning up, maintenance, and processing your prints!","title":"Intro to 3D Printing, Part 4"},{"content":"","date":"16 August 2020","permalink":"/tags/learning/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"learning"},{"content":"","date":"16 August 2020","permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series"},{"content":"","date":"16 August 2020","permalink":"/categories/writing/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"writing"},{"content":" What other things do I need to think about? Now that we\u0026rsquo;ve covered what you need to know before you even get a 3D printer, we need to talk about the hidden costs of printing. There aren\u0026rsquo;t a lot, but there are definitely some things that you\u0026rsquo;ll need to either know about or buy that won\u0026rsquo;t be in the box.\nOver the course of this post, we\u0026rsquo;ll talk about:\nBuild surfaces and materials Getting prints off the bed Power Interference (specifically of the little human kind) Noise considerations Fire hazards Build Surfaces # Every printer has a bed (the build platform that the object is printed onto) but sometimes actually getting the plastic to stick to the bed requires some\u0026hellip; effort. Several surfaces exist, but here are the most common ones:\nPEI, a mildly sticky plastic Glass (just normal plate glass or a mirror) Textured metal Most 3D printers today either use PEI (a light orange color) or black textured plastic for cost purposes. Some nicer printers offer flexible textured metal build surfaces that are removable, though it\u0026rsquo;s often available as an aftermarket upgrade.\nA lot of printers, though mostly machines that are a few years old, use glass as the bed surface of choice. Hot plastic grips to glass very well and releases easily when it\u0026rsquo;s cool. With a quick dash of some cheap hairspray, prints will stick to the glass with no problems.\nThe recommended brand of hairspray is Aqua Net Extra Super Hold \u0026ndash; you can usually find it for a dollar or two at Walmart or your local corner store. Keep in mind that you only need hairspray if your printer uses a glass or mirror build surface. PEI and textured metal don\u0026rsquo;t require any additional help to work, but may need cleaning from time to time. You\u0026rsquo;ll want to pick up some 90%+ isopropyl alcohol to clean them \u0026ndash; you won\u0026rsquo;t need much, as a single bottle will go a long way.\nDO NOT use acetone to clean PEI or textured surfaces; they will be ruined permanently! Other surfaces exist \u0026ndash; everything from machined stone to painter\u0026rsquo;s tape \u0026ndash; but the above listed ones are what you\u0026rsquo;re most likely to find. Hairspray also isn\u0026rsquo;t the only thing you can use to change the properties of surfaces like glass; you can use purpose-built chemicals like 3D Gloop or even things you might already have around the house, like Elmer\u0026rsquo;s Glue Stick!\nGetting Prints Off the Bed # All that talking about different methods of getting prints to stick brings up a good question: how do we get them off the bed when they\u0026rsquo;re done?\nThe most tried-and-true method is to use a sharpened scraper (like a paint scraper) or a purpose-built tool like this one from Gizmo Dorks. If you\u0026rsquo;re careful, wedging a razor blade under the print will often release it without too much issue, but try to stick to tools that have handles for your safety (and the safety of those around you).\nThis is why some people opt for removable, flexible build plates; when the print is finished, you simply remove the build plate with the part on it, then carefully flex the plate \u0026ndash; the part pops off! Take a look at some example retrofit kits here or to see a printer that comes with them, check out the Prusa MK3S here. Power Considerations # When getting ready to run a 3D printer, it\u0026rsquo;s important to remember that prints frequently last for hours at a time, and the printer can\u0026rsquo;t lose power during the print. If you live in an area that is prone to brownouts or power outages, you may want to consider investing in an uninterruptible power supply to plug your printer into. This is definitely not a requirement (for reference, none of the printers I run are on uninterruptible power supplies) but may be something that you might need.\n(Little) Human Interference # Though we talked about little humans in the last post, we\u0026rsquo;re revisiting this topic because playing with a 3D printer while it\u0026rsquo;s off and playing with one while it\u0026rsquo;s running are two very different things. 3D printers are very sensitive pieces of equipment, and if they\u0026rsquo;re bumped or jostled while they\u0026rsquo;re running, those movements will show up as defects in the finished print. It (most likely) won\u0026rsquo;t ruin the work, but it certainly won\u0026rsquo;t help.\nAs interested as small hands may be, it\u0026rsquo;s important that they CANNOT interact with the printer while it\u0026rsquo;s hot. They could severely burn themselves.\nNoise Considerations # A 3D printer is, almost without exception, not a quiet machine. It will hum, sing, and otherwise whirr its way through a print; some homes amplify these sounds and make them seem louder than they are due to their frequencies. Silencing a printer is a complex matter that can sometimes be accomplished through hardware upgrades or by running the machine slower\u0026hellip; but nothing beats a little bit of foam. Check out this video from CNC Kitchen about quieting a 3D printer with a little bit of foam and a concrete tile.\nFire Hazards # Anything that gets very hot can cause a fire, and 3D printers are no exception. Thankfully, the number of fires caused by printers is extremely low and there are some easy things you can do to help guard against the possibility of a fire:\nBuy a small fire extinguisher \u0026ndash; these are what I use; keep it nearby to your printer in a place where it can be easily grabbed Get a smoke detector and install it right above your machine Make sure that the machine is plugged into a power strip or an outlet that you can easily reach if you have to unplug it quickly Hopefully you should never have to deal with anything relating to fires or scares, but it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;playing with fire\u0026rdquo; to not invest in some adequate protection. Also, stay away from any 3D printers under $250 USD. You get that low price when they skimp on safety features. It\u0026rsquo;s not worth it.\nIt is the official recommendation of FilamentColors.xyz that you verify that a working smoke detector is in use for the room where the printer is running. Though the chances of something going wrong are low, it is not something worth betting against. Wrapping Up # In this post, we\u0026rsquo;ve covered a lot of things you need to know prior to (and during) your first and subsequent prints. In the next post, we\u0026rsquo;ll talk about cleaning up prints, dealing with plastic waste, and finishing up your masterpieces with glue and paint!\n","date":"9 August 2020","permalink":"/posts/intro_to_3d_printing_part_3/","section":"Posts","summary":"It\u0026rsquo;s part three!

Now that you\u0026rsquo;ve made it through Part 1, let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at what you need to know about and what you might need to consider before either buying a 3D printer or bringing one into your home. As with every hobby, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of extra things that aren\u0026rsquo;t written on the box; my goal is that you\u0026rsquo;ll be much better prepared should you jump in with both feet.\nThe information is organized into three categories: before you get a 3D printer, before you use it for the first time, and after you use it. All three sections have information that you might find useful, and we recommend reading it all before making a decision. Today\u0026rsquo;s article will only be covering the first section.\nBefore The 3D Printer # The first thing, even before which printer to get, is \u0026ldquo;where will it go\u0026rdquo;? A bedroom? The living room? The garage? A 3D printer requires a fair amount of space to itself; you\u0026rsquo;ll need to make sure you can set aside space roughly the size of a coffee table where the printer will live. Remember that it\u0026rsquo;s not just the machine that you\u0026rsquo;ll need space for \u0026ndash; there will be tools, filament, and more that needs to be stored around or nearby the printer.\nFilament is an even bigger question; though each roll isn\u0026rsquo;t that big, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to eventually wind up with more than expected. Some people opt for storage in closets or cabinets, while others opt for wall-mounted solutions that allow different spools to be easily grabbed. Below are some examples that show how much room this can take up!\nAn example of closet-based storage An example of wall-mounted storage 3D Printers and Pets (or Little Humans) # It\u0026rsquo;s no surprise that most creatures are curious. Cats, dogs, and little humans will want to see what this new thing is that makes noise, and the extra plastic bits (we\u0026rsquo;ll talk about how to deal with plastic waste later) are especially enticing. Most of the time, they\u0026rsquo;ll investigate the machine and then move on, but some pets won\u0026rsquo;t be able to leave it alone. Here\u0026rsquo;s what you\u0026rsquo;ll need to watch out for:\nHot Parts # The nozzle of a 3D printer (the tip of the print head where the plastic comes out) is typically unprotected and the average print head (called the \u0026ldquo;hot end\u0026rdquo;) can reach 250C, which is ~482F. Most prints with PLA take place at or around 210ËšC (410ËšF), which means that little bit of metal is really hot for the entire process of printing. That will cause burns before you notice \u0026ndash; and they hurt! Most 3D printers also have a heated bed, but the temperatures are much lower: usually ~60ËšC (140ËšF) or lower. You\u0026rsquo;ll want to make sure that hands or paws are not in danger of coming into prolonged contact while the machine is running. (To put this into perspective, your household water heats at a maximum of 120ËšF, and safety experts suggest you keep it at an even lower temperature if you have little humans to prevent scalding. So we\u0026rsquo;re talking about a range from a little hotter than household water to pizza-cooking oven heat here.)\nPlastic Waste # After using the printer for a bit, you\u0026rsquo;ll end up with strands of plastic (or little chunks) that aren\u0026rsquo;t part of your finished pieces. These pieces are small enough to be choking hazards for pretty much everything, so it\u0026rsquo;s important to make sure there is a plan for how to deal with them. A small container or trash can nearby will do the trick, but make sure it has a lid if there\u0026rsquo;s any risk of someone going digging for something to play with.\nManaging Hair # Pets are great, but they frequently shed\u0026hellip; everywhere. There\u0026rsquo;s a good chance that a dog or cat checking out a running 3D printer will accidentally leave behind a token of their interest that you\u0026rsquo;ll have to dig out of your finished prints or pick out of the machine. Hair sticks to the oil used in the moving parts of the machine, so you might have to do more maintenance.\nAllergies # You may have heard that PLA, the most popular plastic for 3D printing, is a corn byproduct. If you\u0026rsquo;re worried about working with PLA because of corn allergies, you should know that there shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be an issue; in the process of converting it to a plastic, the profilin (the allergen) is burned off and is not present in the final plastic.\nWrapping Up # In this post, we\u0026rsquo;ve covered concerns and things to be aware of when identifying whether a 3D printer can fit neatly into your home. Next week, we\u0026rsquo;ll talk about preparing for your first print and what comes after.\n","date":"1 August 2020","permalink":"/posts/intro_to_3d_printing_part_2/","section":"Posts","summary":"In part two, we talk about things you need to plan for before getting your first printer and important questions about safety!","title":"Intro to 3D Printing, Part 2"},{"content":" What is this 3D printing thing? There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of information about 3D printing as a hobby, but what does that all boil down to? What do you need to get started? What do you need to know before bringing a printer into your house? What kinds are there?\nThe goal of this series isn\u0026rsquo;t to be an all-encompassing introduction; mostly, we\u0026rsquo;ll touch on the core concepts and give you terms and ideas that you can research later.\nWhat is 3D Printing and what is a 3D Printer? # You already know about printing on paper. 3D printing is a lot like that, but the result is a physical thing rather than text on a page. Instead of ink, a 3D printer uses plastic; instead of reproducing the text on a computer screen, a 3D printer reproduces a digital model that you process and download to it.\nYou can 3D print almost anything. Here are some examples:\na doorknob a leg for that display stand that broke a while ago a bowl for your keys an adapter that fits on a vacuum a figurine a piece of art a jig to help do something a mobility aid to help open jars a robot body a mount for a piece of technology \u0026hellip;there are so many options that you\u0026rsquo;re mostly limited by the physical properties of plastic and your imagination. With that in mind, let\u0026rsquo;s talk about the second question: what is a 3D printer?\nA machine that takes a physical medium (plastic, metal, concrete, chocolate, etc.) and carefully arranges it in a specific shape when guided by a computer. The most common type is one that melts strands of plastic about the diameter of pencil lead into strips the width of a piece of string. Have you ever had a ball of string? Even though the string itself doesn\u0026rsquo;t take up much space, it builds on itself when you have a lot in one place. That\u0026rsquo;s the same concept that most consumer 3D printers operate on.\nThere are a lot of different options with what type of printer to use and what kind of material to use \u0026ndash; like types of fabric, there are hundreds of choices. For this, we\u0026rsquo;ll only focus on the most common options. What You Need # To get started with 3D printing, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a handful of things:\na 3D printer a computer a way to get information from the computer to the printer \u0026ndash; options include: USB cable USB thumbdrive SD card Some printers can even connect to your local network! a program called a slicer material for the printer to use patience We\u0026rsquo;re going to cover that list out of order because there are some terms that we have to get to first.\nPatience # Although it doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem like it belongs there, you\u0026rsquo;ll notice that patience is definitely on that list. 3D printing is a very cool process, but it\u0026rsquo;s not a perfect process. There will be configurations that you have to modify, bolts that will need adjusting, bearings that will need oiling, and results that will need tweaking. This is just a part of the hobby, and if those things do not sound exciting or interesting, then this may not be the hobby for you.\nIt is worth noting that there are machines that don\u0026rsquo;t require anywhere near as much maintenance / \u0026ldquo;hand-holding\u0026rdquo; in order to continue working, but they are usually several thousand dollars (or more). If you\u0026rsquo;re approaching this from the hobbyist standpoint, at least some amount of tinkering will be required.\nThe Material That Gets Printed # Material for 3D printing, called filament, is a very long connected line that is usually wound onto a spool. These spools are sold by weight in one (1) kilogram (2.2 lbs) rolls. The filament is sold in two diameters:\n1.75mm diameter Industry standard \u0026ndash; the majority of printers use this size 3mm diameter This is older and not used as much anymore Consumer 3D printing is entirely based in the metric system. Besides the fact that the metric system is very easy to use, 3D printing is heavily rooted in open source; the first open source 3D printer, the RepRap, was created in Bath, UK, in 2004. The most common, beginner-friendly material to print with is known by its acronym: PLA. It\u0026rsquo;s not very expensive, is easy to work with, and makes reasonably strong parts. There are many different options \u0026ndash; PETG and ABS are also popular, but they usually require some modifications / upgrades and special ventilation and temperature control to use properly.\nThe Slicer # Though it has an ominous name, a slicer is a program that takes a digital model and converts it into instructions that the 3D printer can interpret. These instructions are very detailed and contain all the information needed for a specific 3D printer to build the model. Sliced files (the sets of instructions) are specific to the printer they\u0026rsquo;re created for; if they\u0026rsquo;re given to a different brand or build of printer, unexpected issues (or potentially damage to the printer) may occur.\nSliced files are known as gcode files; gcode is the instruction set that almost all 3D printers use. It\u0026rsquo;s also used by some larger manufacturing tools, like automated mills and lathes. You can read more about gcode here if you\u0026rsquo;re interested.\nThe Computer # As long you have a computer or laptop (not a tablet or smartphone) that runs Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux, then you can find a slicer to use. The three most popular free slicers (PrusaSlicer, Slic3r, and Cura) run on all three operating systems and are very forgiving on slower computers.\nA 3D Printer # The printer itself is where the magic happens \u0026ndash; where everything finally combines to produce a 3D printed object. It takes the sliced file (the gcode file) and the filament, then uses the gcode instructions to build the object one move at a time.\nTo achieve this, the 3D printer uses specialized heaters to melt the filament to very small widths and carefully deposit it onto a build plate (usually glass or another material) so that it can build upwards by putting down more layers of plastic down. Layer by layer, very slowly, an object is built up from the build plate. This process usually takes a long time; even small objects can take much longer than expected. Most small prints can be accomplished in 30 minutes to an hour; it\u0026rsquo;s not uncommon for prints to take two, four, or even 24 hours to complete depending on the size and level of detail.\nWrapping Up # In this post, we\u0026rsquo;ve covered some core concepts of 3D printing; what 3D printing actually looks like and what it entails. Next week, we\u0026rsquo;ll go over the next steps: the stuff you need to know and what you need to do before buying a 3D printer.\n","date":"15 July 2020","permalink":"/posts/intro_to_3d_printing_part_1/","section":"Posts","summary":"Are you a beginner looking for more information on 3D printing?
