It’s been a little over two years since I wrote the last post on my experiences at the children’s hospital. I was talking to a friend yesterday about how I felt that maybe it would be a good idea to write a followup now that I’ve been there for a few years, doing my thing every week. In my role as a hospital volunteer, I play video games as a form of ‘play therapy’ with kids who are unable to leave their rooms for various reasons. Many of the friends that I meet and work with are either ‘frequent fliers’ to the hospital or they’re there for a long time — my longest was just under two years in one stay before they could go home.

Some do not have a home to go to. Fewer still don’t leave at all, but that is a true rarity; many people at the end of their life are discharged so that they can pass in comfort at home or in hospice care. When someone passes inside the hospital walls, a staff-wide email goes out with basic information about the individual, though it’s not uncommon for there to be months between these emails. As a staff member of the hospital (even though I’m a volunteer), I’m held by the same confidentiality and privacy rules as the rest of the staff, which essentially boils down to the following: When someone leaves the hospital, they leave your consciousness. Unless it is a required aspect of our role, we are forbidden from retaining contact information or any lines of communication with a patient or family of a patient. This is important (and these rules are written for very good reasons), but it leaves you with a question: What happened to them?

The only time I hear otherwise is if the family speaks to the media, publishes something for the world to see (like on YouTube or something similar), or reaches back out to the hospital with news. The chances of me hearing about any of these are also astronomically low; what happens most often is that the staff members I work with reach out to me with a “hey, I heard from so-and-so’s family, I thought you might want to know”. Sometimes I follow up myself when I can; I remember stopping by my two-year patient’s room and finding it empty, only for the nurse to give me a pained look and let me know they had been moved to the ICU (intensive care unit) overnight. This particular story ends on a positive note; they were discharged shortly after this stay, healthy and in good spirits, holding the new record for the longest full-time resident of the ward. In the moment, though, there were a lot of questions. Is my friend alive? Will they leave the ICU? Is this the end? In my role, I work with a lot of folks in varying stages of different cancers and stem cell therapies. I’ve seen first-hand the horror that chemotherapy can wreak on a fragile body. In an adult, the effects of cancer are devastating. In a child, the fact that cells are replicating more rapidly due to normal growth means the cancer spreads that much faster. Though children often respond to treatment better than adults, it’s not a panacea; twice now I have looked a patient in the eye when leaving their room, both of us understanding without words that it is the last time we will see each other.

Perhaps one day I will know about a name or two, but for most of them, they slip through my fingers like so many grains of sand. For every bunch that I’ll never hear from again, a few grains stick to my skin; I treasure what I am able to hold. I just wish I could hold more. Side note: if a patient somehow survives a condition with an extraordinarily high mortality rate as a child, all of the doctors that know how to work with their condition only work at the children’s hospital. I’ve worked with several patients in their 30s and 40s during their stays at the hospital; we have no rooms that are set aside for different ages, so their rooms are mixed in with everyone else. They’re always good sports about it, though. ↩︎ ","date":"2025-11-23","objectID":"/empathy-and-trauma-part-two/:5:0","tags":["trauma","hospitals","children"],"title":"Empathy and Trauma, Part Two","uri":"/empathy-and-trauma-part-two/"},{"categories":["projects","python"],"content":"Dangers Lurk in the Depths of Learning As a professional web developer focusing on arcane uses of Django (and others) for arcane purposes, it occurred to me a little while ago that I didn’t actually know how a web framework worked.

A few days later, I had some functionality I was proud of: user-writable views mapping routes (URLs) to views properly parsing URLs with variables in them GET and POST requests HTML template rendering HTTP redirects basic middleware for handling requests and responses I named my little pet project Spiderweb (a web framework just large enough for a spider), and I sent it off to some friends to get feedback on what I was doing well and what wasn’t going well. Out of that feedback, I got two feature requests (Django-style route declaration and form validation with Pydantic), so I got that figured out and kept building. Though I’d been putting it off, there was a specific thing that I wanted to make sure I had: gunicorn support. Gunicorn is the standard runner for production software for pretty much every project I’ve ever worked on (shoutouts to uWSGI though), so ensuring that my baby framework could interact with it was paramount. Gunicorn uses a system called WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) to communicate, so I launched into getting my little framework to speak it. And after poking at it for a while, I had a horrifying realization: there is no way to directly translate SimpleHTTPServer to WSGI. When I started this whole adventure, I thought “you know, the WSGI standard has been around forever, so it’s probably not an issue. How hard can this be?” The WSGI standard has indeed been around since 2003 — which in computing years is essentially forever — but what I’d failed to take into account is that SimpleHTTPServer has been around foreverer. For those keeping track at home, this is part of Python 1.3.

Starting from a minimal viable example of what serving a WSGI application looks like, I reworked all of my logic to fit into this new paradigm, then began to extend. More middleware capabilities came first, then session middleware (and database support), then CSRF middleware, custom error routes, HTML templates, cookies, and most importantly, gunicorn support! Keeping a connection to SimpleHTTPServer let me keep an “insecure dev server” for doing local work, and some careful work in the documentation and examples meant that the dev server and gunicorn could both be used at the same time without changing the code. For folks who have experience with building websites in Python, it should feel pretty familiar: from spiderweb import SpiderwebRouter from spiderweb.response import HttpResponse app = SpiderwebRouter() @app.route(\"/\") def index(request): return HttpResponse(\"HELLO, WORLD!\") if __name__ == \"__main__\": app.start() Running the file will result in a default server being created on http://localhost:8000, and navigating there in your browser of choice should show “HELLO WORLD” as the only content. Docs! Since this post is more about writing Spiderweb more than using it, you can check out the code above and more at the docs! When I was thinking about what I wanted the user experience of views to look like, I made a specific decision that would impact a surprising number of things: a view should not return data (e.g. a string or a dict) but should instead return an explicit intent (with data) from the user of what they expect the framework to do. Some frameworks I’ve used over the years make assumptions about what exactly the user wants — for example, a returning a dict must mean they want a JSON response — and I think that’s kinda silly. Sending data back to the browser should be a deliberate action, and the form that it takes should also be deliberate. This splits the overall lifecycle of an HTTP request into three parts: the Request, the View, and the Response. These three parts have a total of five states: Browser creates a Request All middleware that can do so processes the Request object User-created View receives the Request and returns a Response All middleware that can do so processes the Response object Spiderweb renders the finished Response and sends it to the browser I ended up settling on five different responses, with each one automatically setting the correct headers for you (but can be overridden easily): HttpResponse This is the base response class, and it takes in text that is directly rendered. JsonResponse TemplateResponse Takes in either a path to a Jinja template file or a string template, then renders it with optional context data. RedirectResponse Takes in the path you want to redirect to, then tells the browser to go there instead. FileReponse Sending files can be kind of a pain, and I realized when working with the dev server that it needed to be able to serve its own static files. The FileResponse is mostly for internal use, but is certainly available for others if they need it or want to use it. Tip Funnily enough, implementing FileResponse was where I realized why a notice that I’d seen before from the Django documentation about not serving static files via the framework was actually there. To properly serve a file, not only does the request have to go through the entirety of the middleware stack twice (once for the request and once for the response), it probably is also insecure just by nature of it existing. So, like… maybe don’t do that with Spiderweb either. All of the Response classes have a .render() function that builds the response into something that can be returned to the browser. This has made extending the Response types with your own very easy, and I’m very happy with how it all came together!

Any framework that accepts POST request also needs to be able to protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), which required a lot more research than I had expected. I implemented a naïve version when building the first version of Spiderweb, only to have a coworker point out that my implementation was essentially a complete failure at what it was supposed to do. Hilarious. Implementing it properly involved first adding in database support so that I could build the session middleware, then finally re-implementing CSRF correctly. For database support, I ended up going with peewee, a Python-based Object Relational Mapper (ORM) for interacting with different common databases like SQLite and Postgres. The Best ORM The best ORM, by far, is actually the one built into Django. Called simply “the Django ORM”, this system of interacting with databases is incredibly solid, flexible, and takes the idea of “if you can’t model your query with it, there’s a bug” to extremes. However, the ORM is built into Django in such a way that it cannot be easily extricated. It is technically possible to run the ORM as a standalone project, but it would require downloading the entirety of the Django web framework while using Spiderweb, which definitely enters the territory of “…but why?”. After rebuilding CSRF protection the proper way, I moved on to another security feature that is often an afterthought for other systems (until it’s suddenly very much needed): Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), a vital part of keeping users safe while allowing for larger and more distributed projects. Though it had been my plan from the beginning to implement everything myself and put my own spin on things, I admitted defeat here; the consequences of having a poor implementation here were too high. I turned to django-cors-headers, a project started in 2013 that has been a trusted staple of many production jobs that I’ve worked on over the years. Translating django-cors-headers into the language of Spiderweb wasn’t an easy task, but it did help me better to understand some of the intricacies of the security layer and, in porting the tests that accompany it to make sure I translated it correctly, I discovered several other small bugs in Spiderweb itself that I was able to fix. Roughly 1/3rd of the total development time went into CORS and CSRF protection alone.

Ensuring Spiderweb had extensive (and clear) middleware support means that not only can features be turned on and off at will, but also that new features are very easy for the end user to write for their own personal applications. I’ve always known that middleware was powerful, but the sheer amount that it could handle definitely surprised me.

Python has its own forms of magic, but the idea that there were some design decisions that just needed to be memorized was always a little annoying. In working on Spiderweb, there were several places where I intuitively leaned on either more obscure or “maybe not quite good practices” areas of Python to accomplish what I needed — for example, finding the base path of the script calling Spiderweb is done by inspecting the call stack and variables in a URL are cast to their final types by building class names and querying globals(). This likely seems… questionable… to the outside viewer, but they are decisions that made the most sense at the time and were easy to quickly implement. That’s not to say that these two are examples that should stay in the framework as time goes on; if I end up continuing to support and extend Spiderweb, there are some definite areas for improvement, and these would likely get some intense scrutiny early on. Like many instances of “Django Magic”, I’m sure that they’re just what made sense at the time as opposed to a focus on the proper way to approach the problem.

Definitions! Bit: A one or a zero. Multiple bits come together to form a byte, which can communicate information. Byte (Octet): A byte is eight bits. For example, the letter “a” (specifically the lowercase version) is one byte in size and looks like this: 01100001. Nibble: Only four bits — half of a byte and capable of representing numbers from 0 to 15. For ease of reading, we’ll be mostly using nibbles as examples throughout this post. Binary Numbers: how computers view numbers. This can be a very deep topic, but the gist of it is that all integer numbers are made of bytes. A nibble (a four-byte number) is something like 0000 or 1010, and the way that you read it is by starting at the right and counting left in powers of two. If we look at 1010, you read it by breaking it apart into places. Since there are four places, the meanings of each place are 8-4-2-1. Taking this, we can use our binary number (1010) and look at the values to figure out what we have: (1 * 8) + (0 * 4) + (1 * 2) + (0 * 1), or 8 + 2 = 10. By the same logic, 0000 is (0 * 8) + (0 * 4) + (0 * 2) + (0 * 1), which turns out to be a big whopping zero. Binary Arithmetic: Any operation or modification that involves two numbers, like multiplication or addition. Unary Arithmetic: Any operation or modification that only involves one number. MSB: Most Significant Bit. It’s the bit farthest to the left. ~: A tilde. A very lovely symbol. Sometimes referred to as “that squiggle”. Note that this is all kind of a pain and rather more complicated than it seems to need to be, but a certain amount of complexity is what allows computers to do a lot of math very quickly, and doing it quickly is really what’s important here. Going back to the original question of “what in the world happened when we ran ~4”, it turns out that ~ is a unary operator, in that it does math on a single number. Specifically, what it does is it performs a “NOT” operation on the number. A NOT operation flips all of the bits from 0 to 1 (or vice versa). This is what that looks like (spoiler alert: I’m about to ruin this and make it more complicated): 100 # Starting with 4... ↓↓↓ # ...invert the bits. 011 # This looks like 3, but it's not. I'll explain why. This interaction is called a “Two’s Complement”, and is used by pretty much all modern computers. (As opposed to the One’s Complement, which you can read about separately if you’re interested.) I deliberately left some pieces off of the earlier example, so let’s look at it again. The first thing we need to do is tack on another bit to the left side, and we’ll use that to keep track of whether a number is positive or negative. 0 is positive, 1 is negative. 0 100 # positive 4 ↓ ↓↓↓ # invert the bits 1 011 # negative... five? Here’s where it gets real weird. When reading the complement (the inverted version), you treat the Most Significant Bit (MSB) as a number… that you subtract the others from. The way you read the last number is: 1 0 1 1 # MSB = 1, so it's negative x x x x # ...times... 8 4 2 1 # the placement of the numbers in binary ------- 8 0 2 1 # Normally, we'd sum these together. # However, there are two things different # here: one is that the MSB is 1, which means # it's negative, so we actually have: -8 0 2 1 # Second, we want to take the MSB and # subtract the others from it, which looks # like this: -8 - (2 + 1) -8 - 3 ------ -5 # ...and there's our result. NOT 4 is -5. Fun fact: to get the proper negative version of your starting number, it’s the same process as outlined above, just with adding 1 (0 001) to the number before ‘assembling’ it with the MSB.

Inpatients are folks who have to stay in the hospital for longer periods of time, anywhere from a day or two to months or years.

It’s easier to understand this as threatening from my vantage point. Also thankfully, it’s not something I have to worry about; no coats of any kind for me while on the floors. NO MEN reads a sign on a door with the shutters pulled tightly closed. That sign applies to me, and I cannot help but wonder what is behind that door as I walk past.

Another room that’s not on my list, but representative of a horror I can only imagine. In this case, it’s not that the room is lacking a functional sink; rather, any liquids must be brought in after being drawn from somewhere else. Each sign is placed with care and concern. Each sign tells its own story, and though I don’t know the details, the signs themselves tell enough. After my shift, sometimes I sit in my car and think about the signs I’ve seen that day.

Way back in the dark ages of 2008, Python 2.6 was released. This release was particularly exciting because it brought us such wondrous things as the multiprocessing module, the io module, and codified the with statement as a keyword for doing better-controlled contextual processing. It also brought a lot of existential angst about the upcoming Python 3 release, but we’re skipping over that. Buried in the release notes was a single paragraph that mentioned “oh hey by the way you can now run Python files from inside a zip archive”. This is a pretty accurate representation of how I felt reading this in the future. Imagine, being able to call a zip file with Python and have it actually work: # You don't have to imagine. This works. ❯ echo \"print('hello, world!')\" \u003e\u003e __main__.py ❯ zip test.zip __main__.py adding: __main__.py (stored 0%) ❯ python test.zip Hello, World! This was, somewhat predictably, completely missed by the vast majority of folks. In 2013, PEP 441 attempted to fix this by bringing the whole ‘package your stuff in a zip file’ thing into the public view by adding the zipapp module to the standard library, adding a whole suite of tools to make working with zipapps much easier for the average Python developer. This was such a revolutionary change that it got a whole three sentences in the release notes and was more or less completely overshadowed by the introduction of typing as a core Python feature. Sorry, Daniel and Paul – you tried. Now that we have reasonable support for making and using zipapps, we can cover the single huge glaring issue: no third-party dependencies.

They let you bundle ALL of your Python code into a single zip archive, pass that archive off to someone else, and they can just run it! However, there’s one glaring issue: you can only rely on the standard library. Third party dependencies are right out unless you manually bundle them with your codebase, which is both a pain to do in the first place and an easy way to accidentally run afoul of licenses if you’re not paying close enough attention. I don’t know about you, but I basically never write things that rely only on the standard library – third party dependencies are a fact of life for all the Python developers I know. So how can we get the power of third party dependencies with the pure awesomeness of being able to package an entire runnable program into a zip file? The answer, as it turns out, was figured out by all those cool folks at Twitter who aren’t there anymore. They designed and built pex, a system that solves the third party dependency problem by essentially zipping up the virtual environment (minus the interpreter) and extracting it prior to running the zipapp. The implementation used by pex is functional, though a bit on the slow side. shiv is LinkedIn’s attempt at solving the speed issues of pex while still keeping all of the functionality. (You can find more information about the speed differences between pex and shiv here. You can also find more technical information on shiv’s approach at that link as well.) You only need a few things installed to actually make a shiv app: a recent version of Python an environment that includes shiv a setup.py file that lists all the dependencies of your app your app code itself That’s really it, and in fact, that’s all you need to have in your CI pipeline if you want to automatically build your shiv apps for CI-controlled releases.

For applications where your app just needs to run without tweaking, this means that someone (or something) can just grab your compiled and finished zipapp and just… run it. No fuss and no stress. Okay, maybe not quite 'no fuss'. You’ll want to make sure that you’re ‘compiling’ on the same type of OS that you’re deploying to if you’re bundling any compiled C extensions. Regular Python code should be totally fine. I wouldn’t recommend that you check this out unless I’d given it a thorough test myself; the nonprofit I run, the Grafeas Group, has been running all of our production services as zipapps for the last 8 months. That’s: three Reddit bots a Discord bot a Slack bot a Django monolith that handles our website and APIs Deployments have never been easier (and are completely controlled via Slack commands!) – it’s literally as easy as backing up the existing zipapp, downloading the new one, and running it. The Slack bot, Bubbles, updates itself by downloading the new version on top of the existing one and restarting its own service! The benefit here is that if the new version fails, getting back to a working state just swapping out the older version of the zipapp and restarting the service. What’s that? You made changes to the virtual environment between versions? Doesn’t matter because each zipapp uses its own environment. If it compiles and it works, it can’t be affected by any other zipapp, even later or earlier compilations of the same system. Spinning up a new server is as easy as getting a new VM, installing Python on it, and slapping the zipapps into place with their respective environment variable files. We intentionally keep it simple because this is a volunteer gig and there’s no reason to muddy the devops waters by adding something like Docker. But let’s say you wanted to add Docker or another container; would that be any more complex? Honestly, not really. You’d basically just get the official Python container, drop your zipapp onto the root and set your launch script to call it. It does kind of defeat the purpose of easy updates, but it can be done!

Thankfully, there’s an extra little bit that gets injected into the final zipapp during build time, and there are a couple of utilities there that can help us out. Let’s rebuild our script a little bit – now we’ll do a check to see if shiv is available in the current environment and then print out the directory that our zipapp is in.

Here’s the new cli.py file: import os from pathlib import Path try: from shiv.bootstrap import current_zipfile IN_SHIV = True except ImportError: IN_SHIV = False def main(): print(f\"Calling from {os.getcwd()}...\") if not IN_SHIV: print(\"shiv is not installed.\") print(Path(__file__).parent.parent) else: with current_zipfile() as archive: if archive: print(\"shiv is installed and we are inside a zipapp!\") print(Path(archive.filename).resolve(strict=True).parent) else: print(\"shiv is installed and we are NOT in a zipapp!\") print(Path(__file__).resolve(strict=True).parent.parent) if __name__ == \"__main__\": main() Now, let’s try running it! # outside the environment, calling directly: ❯ python myapp/cli.py Calling from /home/joe/code/test... shiv is not installed. /home/joe/code/test # inside the environment, calling directly: ❯ python myapp/cli.py Calling from /home/joe/code/test... shiv is installed and we are NOT in a zipapp! /home/joe/code/test # calling the zipapp: ❯ ./myapp.pyz Calling from /home/joe/code/test... shiv is installed and we are inside a zipapp! /home/joe/code/test We use this method to create a BASE_DIR variable that’s accessible throughout the application along the lines of Django’s BASE_DIR (which is very wrong when packaged with shiv). That allows easy loading of external files and makes it work the way you expect it to. A little bit of boilerplate, but nothing too bad once you know to watch for it.

I don’t intend to update this as time goes on, so if you’re reading this far from when it was written, just know that it might be out of date. Use your best judgement! As of the brand new Gitea 1.19.0, Gitea finally has a built-in Actions system! It’s intentionally very close to GitHub Actions, meaning that many of the yaml files you’ve carefully built up over the years will just work out of the box! And for the most part, that’s what happens… but since this is a new system, there are always some rough spots. In this case, the question is “what happens if you try to run the GitHub setup-python action on a Debian runner?” Tl;dr: it explodes in a very confusing way. Let’s dive into that. (Want to skip to the important bits? Click here!)

Actually getting the runner set up was pretty great - the full instructions are here, but here’s the basics. On Gitea, you’ll need to start by enabling Actions. This is deceptively simple, but does require editing the app.ini file. Just drop this anywhere in it: [actions] ENABLE = true Restart Gitea and you should see a new option, Runners, in the Site Administration section. Should appear in this general location. After that, you’re good to start on building the runner, and that general process is going to look like this: Build and update your VM Install Docker CE on the runner Grab the precompiled binary and drop it in the home folder I renamed the precompiled binary to act_runner just to make the rest of the steps easy, but after registering the runner, you should be able to run it manually (act-runner daemon) and see it pop up in the Gitea runners list! Awesome! One runner, ready and waiting for a job! At this point, there’s only one more thing you have to do – because this is still technically a beta feature, Actions have to be enabled on a per-repo basis. Go to the repo that you want to test with and go to Settings \u003e Repository \u003e Advanced Settings. Buried in the many options there, you’ll find this one for Actions – enable it and click the save button at the bottom of the section. Sometimes it's hard to find, but it'll be there. Now that we have all the pieces in place, we can finally test some actions! You should be able to use pretty much any GHA file (and Gitea will recognize files in both .github/workflows/*.yaml and .gitea/workflows/*.yaml), but start with a simple one. Since pretty the majority of my projects are in Python, I started with this existing release script for a Python-based system utility I wrote for myself: name: Release on: push: branches: - master jobs: build: runs-on: ubuntu-latest permissions: contents: write steps: - uses: https://github.com/actions/checkout@v2 - uses: https://github.com/actions/setup-python@v4 with: python-version: '3.11.x' - name: Install Env # this should be all we need because shiv will download the deps itself run: | pip install --upgrade pip pip install shiv pip install poetry - name: Add CURRENT_TIME env property run: echo \"CURRENT_TIME_VERSION=v$(date '+%s')\" \u003e\u003e $GITHUB_ENV - name: Build the sucker run: | sed -i -e \"s/?????/${{ env.CURRENT_TIME_VERSION }}/g\" src/__init__.py make build - uses: https://github.com/ncipollo/release-action@v1 with: artifacts: \"utils\" body: \"It's releasin' time\" generateReleaseNotes: false tag: ${{ env.CURRENT_TIME_VERSION }} commit: master token: ${{ secrets.PAT }} You’ll notice that there’s only one change from a standard GHA file – I’ve prepended https://github.com/ to each step that uses an external action (and I’m not even 100% sure if that’s needed, but that was in the examples so I’m rolling with it). Spoiler alert! I learned after posting this that the upload step doesn’t work with Gitea! GitHub allows you to create a release and add assets to that release in a single step, but Gitea requires that you create a release, then attach assets to that release. See the bottom of this page for the updated step you can tweak to get that working on your server. I also had to create a new secret – since I use the Personal Access Token on GitHub added to the repo, I went looking for a suitable replacement on Gitea. I’m very pleased to report that not only can repositories hold secrets (as expected) but you can assign secrets to your user account and they’ll automatically apply to all your repos! I created a basic token with repository permissions and added it as a user secret called PAT – that section of the run file works 100% as expected. Bravo, Gitea! Shh. It's a secret. When I went to run this with a push though, something interesting happened: it exploded on the “setting up Python” step, which I honestly expected to be fairly nondesc","date":"2023-03-23","objectID":"/gitea_actions_and_python/:2:0","tags":["gitea-1.19.0","gitea actions","debian","python"],"title":"Gitea Actions, Python, and Debian","uri":"/gitea_actions_and_python/"},{"categories":["projects"],"content":"The Problem When debugging, the action failed with the following error: ##[debug]Unable to locate executable file: lsb_release. Please verify either the file path exists or the file can be found within a directory specified by the PATH environment variable. Also check the file mode to verify the file is executable. Before we get too deep here, this is a partial red herring, but one that will eventually lead us to the real problem. The reason it’s a red herring is that the error message is correct, but not for an obvious reason. Debian doesn’t ship with lsb-release, the package that will let you run the lsb_release command. (You can install it with sudo apt install lsb-release, but that still won’t solve the issue.) What it’s actually saying is that it can’t find lsb_release on the Docker container the runner downloaded. For reasons I don’t completely understand, this is not a problem that is solvable by simply installing lsb-release in an earlier step of your workflow file – it’ll still explode with the same error. On your runner VM, in the directory where you registered act_runner, there is a hidden file called .runner. If you open that up, you’ll see that there is a section called labels, and it (most likely) looks like this: \"labels\": [ \"ubuntu-latest:docker://node:16-bullseye\", \"ubuntu-22.04:docker://node:16-bullseye\", \"ubuntu-20.04:docker://node:16-bullseye\", \"ubuntu-18.04:docker://node:16-buster\" ] The node:16 containers work well for most things, but for some reason they don’t work out of the box for this use case. What we can do is swap out these images for ones that are configured correctly: \"labels\": [ \"ubuntu-latest:docker://catthehacker/ubuntu:act-latest\", \"ubuntu-22.04:docker://catthehacker/ubuntu:act-22.04\", \"ubuntu-20.04:docker://catthehacker/ubuntu:act-20.04\", \"ubuntu-18.04:docker://catthehacker/ubuntu:act-20.04\" ] After you change out the label section, restart the runner and then restart the job through the Gitea interface (or a push to your repo). Ignore the extra debug 'lsb_release' step! In a tremendously surprising move, even the release action worked out of the box, successfully pushing a release to my repo with no issues. It created the release, but as it turns out, Gitea will not allow you to create a release that contains assets in a single call. Here’s the replacement for the release action listed above: - name: Create release! run: | JSON_DATA=$( printf '%s' \\ '{'\\ '\"tag_name\":\"${{ env.CURRENT_TIME_VERSION }}\",'\\ '\"name\":\"${{ env.CURRENT_TIME_VERSION }}\",'\\ '\"body\":\"RELEASE THE KRAKEN\"'\\ '}' \\ ) echo \"\"\"release_id=$(\\ curl -X POST \\ -s https://${{ secrets.SERVER_URL }}/api/v1/repos/${GITHUB_REPOSITORY%/*}/${{ github.event.repository.name }}/releases \\ -H \"Authorization: token ${{ secrets.PAT }}\" \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \"$JSON_DATA\" \\ | python3 -c \"import sys, json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['id'])\"\\ )\"\"\" \u003e\u003e $GITHUB_ENV - name: Upload assets! run: | curl https://${{ secrets.SERVER_URL }}/api/v1/repos/${GITHUB_REPOSITORY%/*}/${{ github.event.repository.name }}/releases/${{ env.release_id }}/assets \\ -H \"Authorization: token ${{ secrets.PAT }}\" \\ -F attachment=@utils Not particularly glamorous, and getting this figured out was kind of a pain, but hey, it’s at least fairly portable. Besides, copying and pasting between workflow files is a time-honored tradition. :joy: Major props to the Gitea team for getting this out the door – I’m so excited that it’s here and very excited to use it on my repos!

As far as handheld games are concerned, I’ve always preferred Nintendo’s offerings, and the 3DS (especially the New 3DS) finds itself at a very interesting crossroads. Not only can it play relatively recent games and play them well, it has surprisingly-capable emulation capabilities. From MAME cabinets to the Playstation and more, basically everything that I want to emulate (that isn’t the glory of the N64 :sob:) is available and working flawlessly. Plus, the 3DS is officially dead as a platform, which has two primary benefits: they’re incredibly easy to jailbreak and alternative eShop options allow… finding… whatever game you’re interested in for the platform, which is extremely helpful when the official eShop shuts down later this month. The New 3DS XL was manufactured until 2019, so there are still a lot of them floating around, and the sheer number of units with the relatively recent closure of the line means there’s a lot of activity in the homebrew and jailbreaking scene.

It is, of course, not without flaws (mostly involving labeling and different cable types), but is otherwise basically my favorite cable. Strategically placed USB-C cables dot my house, enabling charging capabilities beyond my wildest dreams. (There are a couple of Micro-USB cables too; I’m not a monster. But honestly if I could get everything in USB-C, I would.) Every ‘special’ cable that I can eliminate from my life is one less cable that I have to manage and find a place for. That’s not to say I’m completely against the use of adapters, either; they have their place. If the special cable I’m working with can use 5v in to charge, sometimes it’s quite easy to just lop off the end and solder in a USB-C connector with the appopriate resistors so that it can now act as an adapter of sorts on the chargers we already have access to. But sometimes… sometimes it’s more fun to just fix the connector. If the connector you’re using is small enough, you might be able to simply unsolder the micro USB port (or whatever was there before) and solder in a USB-C breakout board and map the outputs to the appropriate places on the board. However, this has three potential issues: there might not be enough space anyway the smaller the connector, the less likely it has the required two resistors in order to set the charge voltage any time you have to make substantial changes to an existing circuit board, even more standard additions like this that don’t require SMD soldering work, it gets messy. The number of tools required and the amount of space it takes up is surprisingly large, even though you don't need a lot of specialty equipment. You’ve probably noticed that’s a picture of the Gameboy Advance SP again; since I mostly did the 3DS build for me, I didn’t really take pictures.

It’s useful to get the location of where to solder to the motherboard, but the rest isn’t very useful. We both used this USB-C breakout board from Sparkfun; at $5 a piece, they aren’t the cheapest but they already have the resistors in place to request a 5v supply from the other end of a USB-C \u003c-\u003e USB-C cable, which is critical for this application and also means I don’t need to deal with surface-mount components (which makes me a happy camper). In their design, they trimmed away a somewhat substantial portion of the support material around the tip of the stylus in order to fit the board into place; the trick here is that it’s very close to the shoulder buttons and the ZR button has a bit of internal travel inside the case. The board itself has quite a lot of extra space on it even for how small it is, so I opted for a slightly more violent method: reshaping the PCB itself instead of trimming away as much of the case. By removing a lot of the extra unused PCB, it fit nicely in a space closer to the button and gives the back of the console a much cleaner look in my opinion. The important parts are removing both of the sections of PCB for the mounting holes, as with careful installation it butts perfectly against the internal shape of the battery housing. In fact, in my console, the port is not held in place by anything but the pressure of the case and weaseling it into the single spot that it fits. I’ll be honest; this install was a bear. The motherboard has eight micro ribbon cables on three of the four sides, and two of those ribbon cables are on the bottom of the motherboard. Of the eight cables, they use three different connection methods; I guess because screw you, that’s why? This video on performing a motherboard swap was instrumental for learning how to remove each one in a way that doesn’t damage all the connectors. I’d show you the inside of mine, but I’m hesitant to open it again. As it stands, you’ll have to take this as proof that it works: Charge, baby, charge. Would I do this again? No, I don’t think so. The entire install took about 3.5 hours for me, and they weren’t particularly fun. However, I’m super stoked about the newfound functionality of the console and am looking forward to putting it to the test during some travel later this year.

It’s a single-file script that animates a lovely ocean scene using only text! Fish swim, a small castle chills out in the corner, and occasionally special events happen (watch for the shark and appearances of Nessie!). I ran it in a small terminal window every day around my normal work, enjoying it simply for being a quick escape from whatever problem I was working on at the time. ASCIIQuarium screenshot courtesy of [robobunny.com](https://robobunny.com) During that time, I had an idea: use a low-power computer, an old display, and a bit of solder to create a permanent display for asciiquarium to have my very own digital fish tank that wouldn’t need feeding (and had pretty colors)!

As an older TV, my connection options were limited to VGA, RCA, component, or S-Video. That wasn’t a total killer though, because the Raspberry Pi 1 Model A (retro circa 2013!) has an RCA video out! SparkFun Electronics from Boulder, USA - Raspberry Pi - Model A, CC BY 2.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=26785859 Our donor screen is an Emerson 22\" TV / DVD combo. It served a loyal life, delivering many marathons of the Lord of the Rings (extended editions!), but was eventually relegated to the garage. There’s no remote anymore, so who knows what extra features it’s supposed to have. What we care about, and what matters, is that when it turns on, it launches directly into Video 1 mode (where our RCA input is plugged in). To power the Pi, I found an old Samsung phone charger that we don’t have anymore and a no-brand micro-USB cable. After testing to ensure that it met the power requirements of the Pi, it was time to get the software sorted.

The original source can be downloaded from Kirk Baucom’s site, but the version I’m running is actually one that I edited myself to reduce the frequency of special events and make it more suited for this type of installation. The modified version can be downloaded from GitHub. I want to give a major shout-out to the Raspberry Pi Foundation for their amazing support of old hardware; getting the Pi set up was a breeze by just downloading the latest command-line-only version of Raspbian and flashing it to an SD card using the new Raspberry Pi Imager. LC_LOCALES and You I ran into one issue with LC_LOCALES and other keys not being set correctly; running “raspi-config” and setting the locale information there fixed the problem after rebooting. Perl is included in the default of Raspbian, so the only requirements we have are to install the curses library (a library that allows us to draw in the terminal) and install the Term::Animation package using Perl’s CPAN command to actually handle the movements. # this first part might take a while sudo apt update sudo apt upgrade -y # dependencies! sudo apt install libcurses-perl git # just accept the defaults if it asks you things sudo cpan install Term::Animation # Grab the modified code git clone https://github.com/itsthejoker/asciiquarium After cloning the repo, we can move into the folder (cd asciiquarium) and make the program runnable with chmod +x asciiquarium.

One of the things that I wanted for this build was that it would only require one cable; that meant that I had to wire the USB charger into the TV somehow. After cracking open the charger to free the circuit board, opening up the back of the TV (don’t do this unless you know what you’re doing!) showed that there was a great safe place to solder in the charger with access to the 120v power cable. Test fits and a little hot glue helped secure the charger in an out-of-the-way location on the main board of the TV. One gutted charger in the guts of a TV! With the USB power in place, only two things remain: securing the Pi to the back of the TV and getting it ready to install. The first was easy enough to solve with – you guessed it – more hot glue (though the Pi was placed into a case first!). The wiring was connected again to make sure it worked, and this is the wiring arrangement I came up with: An acrylic case to the rescue for keeping my Pi safe! After confirming that it worked as expected, the next step is to pull the SD card and back it up. This installation will be turned on and off by the power plug through a timer, so it’s important to make the operating system read-only to guard against corruption. After making it read-only, no changes can be made – so backing it up prior to performing that operation is critical. Back up your work! Seriously, if you’re following along, back up your SD card now. Take a full disk image using something like Win32Imager – you don’t want to make your OS read-only and THEN find out that something is wrong. You’d have to wipe it and start from scratch. I used this article from Adafruit to actually perform the operation with the card plugged into a different Pi, and as far as I can tell it worked perfectly. When the SD card was slotted back into the Pi on the TV, everything worked perfectly! …well, almost. It turns out that pretty much all TVs are designed so that when they’re plugged in, they don’t turn on automatically. This is a problem for this install because it’ll be turned on and off by the timer. Thankfully, the internet comes through once more with a solution… involving more hot glue. Yep. Not going anywhere.

One of the best parts of owning a 3D printer is the anticipation and excitement of seeing the completed part that it just created. A machine in my home that can take a few meters of plastic line and turn it into something amazing – what’s not to like? Every 3D printer has a different way of announcing that it’s done with a job, but generally the important part is that the machine will move the hot end out of the way so you can access the part that just finished printing. This next part is so important it’s going in its own little bubble: Tip You won’t be able to remove a printed object from the build surface of the printer immediately when it’s done – you must wait for it to cool down. The part will get progressively easier to remove as the machine cools down; the sooner you try to remove it, the more you risk damaging your part and printer through brute force. Sometimes a part will pop off the build plate after it cools down and you can pick it right up… but sometimes it will require some gentle (but firm) force. You’ll want to use the print removal tool – or, very carefully, a utility knife blade – to get under the part so that it can lift off the build plate. Warning You’ll want to make sure to be extra careful if you’re using anything sharp; one wrong move and you’ll damage the build plate, the part you just printed, or yourself. Sometimes removing a part can take a few minutes, so don’t be discouraged. Take your time and go slow. This is also a great reason to look into a 3D printer that has a removable, flexible build plate: it makes removing prints much easier at the cost of a slightly more expensive setup.

Sometimes parts don’t stick to the build plate; sometimes the nozzle will jam; sometimes things won’t move the way that they should. It’s not just you – it’s something that literally everyone deals with in this hobby. Sometimes it will take several tries before you get a result that you’re happy with, and that may require tweaking the physical printer or the settings in your slicer program. Most of the time, print failures don't get very far! Image thanks to @tgibriday The best way to approach this when it happens is to clean up the plastic spaghetti and try again. It’s important to watch at least the first layer get printed, as most failures will happen at this time. There are many, many different things that could be wrong (nozzle too close to the bed, nozzle too far away from the bed, wrong temperatures, oil on the build surface, etc.) It’s also a great idea to check on things occasionally just to make sure that it’s still trundling along. Sometimes they're a bit more effort to clean up -- this one wasn't caught for several hours. Image thanks to @uncommonparts This particular print failed sometime during the night! Sometimes failures trend more towards “crap, it’s broken” levels – and that’s okay too! That’s where the tinkering comes in, because there are very few issues that are not fixable.

There’s no use in keeping any of this, so it goes straight into the trash. You’ll want to keep a small trash can nearby so that you have somewhere handy to throw these bits – they accumulate startlingly fast.

Small strings can be vaporized with a hairdryer set to “hot” and little blobs can pop off with a little help from a hobby knife. Tip If you don’t already have a hobby knife (commonly sold under the brand names X-Acto and Excel), we recommend one that tightens at the back of the knife instead of at the blade. This type also commonly has a small metal plate that stops it from rolling on the table! Hobby knives are extremely sharp; make sure it stays capped and put away when not in use. Some more complicated parts will require support material – extra plastic that will get thrown away but whose only job is to help the overall print succeed – that will need to be trimmed away. A small pair of micro pliers can help break away material and a set of flush cutters will help tremendously. Tip Flush cutters are so useful that they tend to disappear to other places. If tools have a habit of misplacing themselves, you may want to get a few of them.

If that’s the case, there may be a few pieces that fit together with screws or glue. Screws are easier because they don’t usually scuff up the surface of your work, but they have extra costs in actually buying the hardware… so sometimes that just leaves glue as the next best option. If gluing together parts is something that you’re interested in doing, you’ll want to put some plastic-specific glues on your wishlist; something like 3D Gloop may be a good place to start. Tip Although it may be tempting, be careful when using superglue (sometimes called cyanoacrylate or just “CA” glue) – it’s really good at what it does, but reacts badly with most plastics and leaves white blemishes everywhere it touches. That may not be an issue depending on what you’re gluing together, but it’s worth noting. Sometimes prints just don’t have enough pizzazz if they’re just the color of the plastic, so painting might be the next step.

Most of the time, you’ll just need a little oil; if you’re in a pinch, 3-In-One Multipurpose Oil will do a great job of keeping things moving smoothly, but for most things on a 3D printer some white lithium grease is the best choice. 3-In-One or other lighter oils will need to be reapplied more frequently, but they also work better at getting into cracks and crevices. Tip Don’t use anything heavier than white lithium grease; if the grease is too heavy (or if there’s too much), it will cause more of a problem than not having it at all. Also… Warning Do not use WD-40! They say it can do anything… and what it will do is gum up the bearings in your machine. Stick with the two options outlined above. Dust and hair stick to grease, so if the machine is in a dusty (or pet-heavy) area, it might need additional cleaning. A little compressed air can help get plastic bits and dust out of hard-to-reach corners! Belts degrade over time (very slowly) so an occasional check to make sure they’re still tight is a good idea.

Several surfaces exist, but here are the most common ones: PEI, a mildly sticky plastic Glass (just normal plate glass or a mirror) Textured metal Most 3D printers today either use PEI (a light orange color) or black textured plastic for cost purposes. Some nicer printers offer flexible textured metal build surfaces that are removable, though it’s often available as an aftermarket upgrade. A lot of printers, though mostly machines that are a few years old, use glass as the bed surface of choice. Hot plastic grips to glass very well and releases easily when it’s cool. With a quick dash of some cheap hairspray, prints will stick to the glass with no problems. Tip The recommended brand of hairspray is Aqua Net Extra Super Hold – you can usually find it for a dollar or two at Walmart or your local corner store. Keep in mind that you only need hairspray if your printer uses a glass or mirror build surface. PEI and textured metal don’t require any additional help to work, but may need cleaning from time to time. You’ll want to pick up some 90%+ isopropyl alcohol to clean them – you won’t need much, as a single bottle will go a long way. Watch out! DO NOT use acetone to clean PEI or textured surfaces; they will be ruined permanently! Other surfaces exist – everything from machined stone to painter’s tape – but the above listed ones are what you’re most likely to find. Hairspray also isn’t the only thing you can use to change the properties of surfaces like glass; you can use purpose-built chemicals like 3D Gloop or even things you might already have around the house, like Elmer’s Glue Stick!

The most tried-and-true method is to use a sharpened scraper (like a paint scraper) or a purpose-built tool like this one from Gizmo Dorks. If you’re careful, wedging a razor blade under the print will often release it without too much issue, but try to stick to tools that have handles for your safety (and the safety of those around you). Tip This is why some people opt for removable, flexible build plates; when the print is finished, you simply remove the build plate with the part on it, then carefully flex the plate – the part pops off!

A bedroom? The living room? The garage? A 3D printer requires a fair amount of space to itself; you’ll need to make sure you can set aside space roughly the size of a coffee table where the printer will live. Remember that it’s not just the machine that you’ll need space for – there will be tools, filament, and more that needs to be stored around or nearby the printer. Filament is an even bigger question; though each roll isn’t that big, it’s easy to eventually wind up with more than expected.

Cats, dogs, and little humans will want to see what this new thing is that makes noise, and the extra plastic bits (we’ll talk about how to deal with plastic waste later) are especially enticing. Most of the time, they’ll investigate the machine and then move on, but some pets won’t be able to leave it alone. Here’s what you’ll need to watch out for: Hot Parts The nozzle of a 3D printer (the tip of the print head where the plastic comes out) is typically unprotected and the average print head (called the “hot end”) can reach 250C, which is ~482F. Most prints with PLA take place at or around 210˚C (410˚F), which means that little bit of metal is really hot for the entire process of printing. That will cause burns before you notice – and they hurt! Most 3D printers also have a heated bed, but the temperatures are much lower: usually ~60˚C (140˚F) or lower. You’ll want to make sure that hands or paws are not in danger of coming into prolonged contact while the machine is running. (To put this into perspective, your household water heats at a maximum of 120˚F, and safety experts suggest you keep it at an even lower temperature if you have little humans to prevent scalding. So we’re talking about a range from a little hotter than household water to pizza-cooking oven heat here.) Plastic Waste After using the printer for a bit, you’ll end up with strands of plastic (or little chunks) that aren’t part of your finished pieces. These pieces are small enough to be choking hazards for pretty much everything, so it’s important to make sure there is a plan for how to deal with them. A small container or trash can nearby will do the trick, but make sure it has a lid if there’s any risk of someone going digging for something to play with. Managing Hair Pets are great, but they frequently shed… everywhere. There’s a good chance that a dog or cat checking out a running 3D printer will accidentally leave behind a token of their interest that you’ll have to dig out of your finished prints or pick out of the machine. Hair sticks to the oil used in the moving parts of the machine, so you might have to do more maintenance.

If you’re worried about working with PLA because of corn allergies, you should know that there shouldn’t be an issue; in the process of converting it to a plastic, the profilin (the allergen) is burned off and is not present in the final plastic.

You already know about printing on paper. 3D printing is a lot like that, but the result is a physical thing rather than text on a page. Instead of ink, a 3D printer uses plastic; instead of reproducing the text on a computer screen, a 3D printer reproduces a digital model that you process and download to it. You can 3D print almost anything. Here are some examples: a doorknob a leg for that display stand that broke a while ago a bowl for your keys an adapter that fits on a vacuum a figurine a piece of art a jig to help do something a mobility aid to help open jars a robot body a mount for a piece of technology …there are so many options that you’re mostly limited by the physical properties of plastic and your imagination. With that in mind, let’s talk about the second question: what is a 3D printer? Info A machine that takes a physical medium (plastic, metal, concrete, chocolate, etc.) and carefully arranges it in a specific shape when guided by a computer. The most common type is one that melts strands of plastic about the diameter of pencil lead into strips the width of a piece of string. Have you ever had a ball of string? Even though the string itself doesn’t take up much space, it builds on itself when you have a lot in one place. That’s the same concept that most consumer 3D printers operate on. Info There are a lot of different options with what type of printer to use and what kind of material to use – like types of fabric, there are hundreds of choices. For this, we’ll only focus on the most common options.

There will be configurations that you have to modify, bolts that will need adjusting, bearings that will need oiling, and results that will need tweaking. This is just a part of the hobby, and if those things do not sound exciting or interesting, then this may not be the hobby for you. It is worth noting that there are machines that don’t require anywhere near as much maintenance / “hand-holding” in order to continue working, but they are usually several thousand dollars (or more). If you’re approaching this from the hobbyist standpoint, at least some amount of tinkering will be required.

These spools are sold by weight in one (1) kilogram (2.2 lbs) rolls. The filament is sold in two diameters: 1.75mm diameter Industry standard – the majority of printers use this size 3mm diameter This is older and not used as much anymore Tip Consumer 3D printing is entirely based in the metric system. Besides the fact that the metric system is very easy to use, 3D printing is heavily rooted in open source; the first open source 3D printer, the RepRap, was created in Bath, UK, in 2004. The most common, beginner-friendly material to print with is known by its acronym: PLA. It’s not very expensive, is easy to work with, and makes reasonably strong parts. There are many different options – PETG and ABS are also popular, but they usually require some modifications / upgrades and special ventilation and temperature control to use properly.

These instructions are very detailed and contain all the information needed for a specific 3D printer to build the model. Sliced files (the sets of instructions) are specific to the printer they’re created for; if they’re given to a different brand or build of printer, unexpected issues (or potentially damage to the printer) may occur. Sliced files are known as gcode files; gcode is the instruction set that almost all 3D printers use. It’s also used by some larger manufacturing tools, like automated mills and lathes. You can read more about gcode here if you’re interested.

It takes the sliced file (the gcode file) and the filament, then uses the gcode instructions to build the object one move at a time. To achieve this, the 3D printer uses specialized heaters to melt the filament to very small widths and carefully deposit it onto a build plate (usually glass or another material) so that it can build upwards by putting down more layers of plastic down. Layer by layer, very slowly, an object is built up from the build plate. This process usually takes a long time; even small objects can take much longer than expected. Most small prints can be accomplished in 30 minutes to an hour; it’s not uncommon for prints to take two, four, or even 24 hours to complete depending on the size and level of detail.
